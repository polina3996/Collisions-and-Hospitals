<h>Collisions and nearest hospitals Data Analysis</h>

In this analysis I train a skill of proximity analysis, calculating distances and placing buffer polygons onto map.

<h>Data</h>

I had the next data for my project:
- SHP-file with major motor vehicle collisions in 2013-2018 in New York City
- SHP-file with hospitals in New York City

<h>Task</h>

I'm as a part of a crisis response team want to identify how hospitals have been responding to crash collisions in New York City. I figure out the percentage of area with distant collisions(more than 10 km from the nearest hospital) and will try to decrease this percentage to less than 10% by suggesting 2 locations for new hospitals.
